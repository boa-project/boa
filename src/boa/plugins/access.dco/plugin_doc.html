<p>The default and basic "Digital Content Object" driver, used to browse, edit, manage, etc all digital content objects contained on a digital content object repository.</p>
<p>DCO Driver implements all the standard actions, including upload/download, moving the files in various ways. It registers the stream "app.dco" in the application, that is able to read both local filesystem and zip archives (using PclZip included in the core).</p>
<p>It is based on the most standard access driver, Filse System, so it comes with an important set of options that can be configured either at a plugin level ("Plugin parameters") or at a repository level ("Instance Parameters"). Please review them carefully, as many of the common usage problems can often be solved by tweaking these options.</p>
<p>Actions of this driver are not inside the manifest.xml (too big) but in a separate file, dcoActions.xml. It's a good starting point to have a look at this file when you want to hack something in the application.</p>
